5-Minute Pesto Pasta
This is a straightforward and fresh recipe that comes together in a matter of minutes.
Ingredients
Pasta: Quick-cook dried spaghetti or your preferred shape.
Pesto: Store-bought pesto is the fastest option.
Optional garnish: Fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese. 
Instructions
Boil the pasta. Follow the package directions for your quick-cook pasta. While it cooks, you can get the rest of the meal ready.
Reserve pasta water. Before draining the pasta, scoop out a small amount of the starchy cooking water.
Combine ingredients. Drain the pasta and immediately toss it with the pesto in the warm pot. Add a little of the reserved pasta water to help the sauce emulsify and coat the pasta smoothly.
Garnish and serve. Twirl the pasta onto a plate, then sprinkle with grated cheese and fresh basil leaves, if desired.

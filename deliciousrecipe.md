15-Minute Honey Garlic Chicken
Prep Time: 5 minutes
Cook Time: 10 minutes
Total Time: 15 minutes
Yields: 4 servings
Ingredients
1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into ½-inch cubes)
2 teaspoons olive oil
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
3 cloves garlic (minced)
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
Salt and black pepper to taste
Instructions
Heat the skillet: Pour olive oil into a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat.
Season and cook the chicken: Lightly season the cubed chicken with salt and pepper. Add the chicken to the hot skillet and cook for 3–4 minutes, or until one side is browned.
Prepare the glaze: While the chicken cooks, whisk together the honey, soy sauce, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using) in a small bowl.
Finish cooking: Flip the chicken pieces and pour the honey garlic glaze over them, tossing to coat. Continue to cook for another 4–5 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened into a sticky glaze.
Serve: For a complete meal, serve the honey garlic chicken with steamed rice and your favorite vegetables, such as broccoli or green beans.
